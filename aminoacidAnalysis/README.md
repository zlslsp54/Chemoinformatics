## Amino Acid Analysis

### 1. Data Check

  - Read aminoacids.csv file by pandas. It makes dataframe of bunch of series
  - Features
  - Covariance vs Correlation

### 2. Preprocessing

  - Scale preprocessing
  - Transpose

### 3. PCA

  - What is PCA?
  - Why we use PCA?
  - Explained Variance

### 4. Clustering

  - K-Means

### 5. Result

  - It can be seen that similar amino acids are indeed grouped roughly together, with the charged and polar amino acids in one region (e.g. Arg, Lys, Glu, Asp), the small hydrophobic amino acids forming another group (e.g. Ala, Pro, Val) and the aromatic amino acids in a third region(e.g. Phe, Trp)
